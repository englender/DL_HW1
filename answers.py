**Your answer: 
Increasing the k up to a certain value will improve generalization. This happens because the increment of 
the k value helps avoid giving a lot of weight to noise samples in the classification process. If we increase the k 
value too much, we will give weight to samples that are far from the test sample, and might make our prediction wrong.
In our case the best k value is 3, which gave us accuracy of 92%.

**Your answer: 
1. When training on the entire train-set and selecting a model with respect to the train-set accuracy, we risk overfitting our model. 
Because we are trying to choose the model's hyperparameters based on the same data that we train the model on, we will ensure that the model will work perfectly
on the train-set but this will reduce the model generalization for unseen data. In conclusion, using k-fold CV is better than this method.
2. When selecting the best model with respect to the test-set accuracy, we ensure that our model will work the best on our specific given test-set, and once again we
risk in overfitting our model to a specific test-set and we will reduce the model generalization for unseen data. In other words, when we want to check 
if our model has good performance we check the test-set and get high results because we calibrated the model based on the same set, but we can
anticipate that we will achieve much lower results when facing unseen data.
