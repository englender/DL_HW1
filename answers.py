part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer: 
Increasing the k up to a certain value will improve generalization. This happens because the increment of 
the k value helps avoid giving a lot of weight to noise samples in the classification process. If we increase the k 
value too much, we will give weight to samples that are far from the test sample, and might make our prediction wrong.
In our case the best k value is 3, which gave us accuracy of 92%.
